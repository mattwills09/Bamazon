# Bamazon

For this project we were tasked with creating a storefront type (amazon) application that would be run from the terminal using Node, and linked to a SQL database.  When the user places an order of a specific item, the stock quantity of the item will also be deducted from the database.  Screenshots of the SQL database is found below:

Screenshots for the javascript code and terminal store are found below here, and after the activities in class, this part of the project was not that difficult.  The most bugs I had were making sure that the correct callback functions were inside the correct parent functions so that everything would go smoothly.  I had sat with Aaron and Bryan briefly after class and was able to get everything in order.
